# THEC64-keyboard
Use THEC64 with X in Debian Jessie Linux. Since THEC64 keyboard doesn't have Alt, we exchange Alt and Win key.
The other keys are fixed so that the keyboard works similar to C64 in Linux with X.

Run the install script inside Debian Jessie Linux for THEC64, then reboot.

It was intended that Shift+Down and Shift+Right should work as Up and Left, respectively, but this does not work now.

You find Debian Jessie for THEC64 and THEC64 MINI here:
